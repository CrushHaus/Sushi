# Sushi
My Sushi Reccomendation engine.

This is a Sushi Recommendation Engine built into an existing SushiAuthority website the engine was built using Neo4j graph DB. Ajax and javascript are used to connect the endpoints between the website and Neo4j creating the table of information.
The reccomendation engine is used to allow a person to select a specific fish and find all the fish that they may not have tried or may like based on there relationship in the graph it also produces a list of the rolls related to the fish so they know what to order or ask for when they go to a Sushi restaurant.
